# Building VernamFS for the arm-linux platform, as used at APL/UW.
# Requires libfuse compiled for arm-linux also.
#
# APL/UW has libfuse cross-compiled for the arm-linux target,
# installed under our local 'maken' build infrastructure.  This build
# is thus highly-specific to APL/UW.  
#
# You probably want to be building VernamFS for x86/amd64, see
# ../Makefile.
