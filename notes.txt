Implementing a one time pad (OTP) filesystem, from ideas from Sabo/Campbell.

Like VirtualBox, VMware engines and their layout of virtual drives, we
need a 

Header
Table, like a FAT (DOS)
Data

The FAT is likely fixed at creation time.  

Aspects of the Table and Data area are stored in the Header, much like
the 'superblock' of a filesystem.

The backing store is the one time pad data, of some length.

The Table takes up N sectors/pages of the OTP.  Its entries are

1 name, say 128 bytes.  Written once, so NOT plaintext-stored.

2 offset, in sectors/pages/bytes: written once, so NOT
plaintext-stored

3 length, in bytes.  Updated, so MUST be stored in the clear??  But
NOT if length held until 'close' in ram only.

Need two pointers, both of which ARE stored in the clear in the
Header.

1 Offset of next FAT entry, or index, equivalent.

2 Offset of next data write

Suddenly odd fuse mount errors.  i am not understanding how my argc,
argv re-allocation is somehow confusing fuse. I want to do this:

./vernamfs mount OPTFILE fuseOptions mountPoint

so i skip past 3 cmd line args: 

1 vernamfs

2 'mount' sub-command

3 OPTFILE

so I invoke fuse_main with argc-3, argv+3

But it is not working.  How much of the 'real' cmd line does fuse_main
expect/need to see?


With version 26 -> fuse_main takes 4 args

With version 25 (and earlier?) -> takes 3 args.


vfs mount FILE -d mountPoint NULL

0   1     2    3  4          5  argc = 5

want

vfs -d mountPoint NULL 

0    1  2         3  argc = 3

So 3 -> 1, 4 -> 2, 5 -> 3  and argc -= 2

newArgc = argc - 2

for i = 1, i <= newArgc, i++
  argv[i] = argv[i+2]

vfs cmd FILE mountPoint NULL

argc = 4

newArgc = 2

for i = 1; <= 2; i++

  argv[1] = mountPoint
  argv[2] = NULL

BUT: we must have a -s in there too, so use argv[1], was cmd, to hold
-s, and shift fuseOptions down 1, NOT 2.

vfs cmd FILE mountPoint NULL

argc = 4

to

vfs -s mountPoint NULL

argc = 3

argv[1] = -s

for i = 2; i < argc; i++
  argv[i] = argv[i+1]

vfs cmd file -f mounPoint NULL   argc = 5

argv[1] = -s

argv[2] = -f

argv[3] = mounPoint

argv[4] = NULL

argc = 4

Issues on arm-linux (c005):

Trying

$ mkdir mnt

$ vernamfs mount some.otp mnt

$ seq 100 > seq.100

$ mv seq.100 mnt

is not working.  Running the mv under strace:

stat64("mnt/seq.100", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0222, st_size=0, ...}) = 0                                                                                        
access("mnt/seq.100", W_OK)             = 0                                                                                                              
rename("seq.100", "mnt/seq.100")        = -1 EXDEV (Invalid
cross-device link)

See how the rename short circuit for a mv fails.  Expected.  Recall
likely the 'mv' command is from BusyBox.


lstat64("seq.100", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=292, ...}) = 0                                                                                         
unlink("mnt/seq.100")                   = 0                                                                                                              
lstat64("seq.100", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0644, st_size=292, ...}) = 0                                                                                         
lstat64("mnt/seq.100", {st_mode=S_IFREG|0222, st_size=0, ...}) = 0                                                                                       
open("seq.100", O_RDONLY|O_LARGEFILE)   = 3                                                                                                              
open("mnt/seq.100", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_LARGEFILE, 0100644) = -1
EEXIST (File exists)

This is the root of the failure.  Open returning -1.  Curiously, there
is no call to vernamfs_open at all, so the -1 value must be returned
from the main fuse library.


unlink("mnt/seq.100")                   = 0                                                                                                              
open("mnt/seq.100", O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_LARGEFILE, 0100644) = -1 EEXIST (File exists)                                                              
write(2, "mv: can't open 'mnt/seq.100': Fil"..., 42mv: can't open 'mnt/seq.100': File exists  

The sequence of calls we see for the attempted mv is:

vernamfs_getattr: /                                                             
vernamfs_getattr: /seq.100                                                      
vernamfs_unlink: /seq.100                                                       
vernamfs_getattr: /seq.100                                                      
vernamfs_unlink: /seq.100                                                       

Note no opens!
