Implementing a one time pad (OTP) filesystem, from ideas from Sabo/Campbell.

Like VirtualBox, VMware engines and their layout of virtual drives, we
need a 

Header
Table, like a FAT (DOS)
Data

The FAT is likely fixed at creation time.  

Aspects of the Table and Data area are stored in the Header, much like
the 'superblock' of a filesystem.

The backing store is the one time pad data, of some length.

The Table takes up N sectors/pages of the OTP.  Its entries are

1 name, say 128 bytes.  Written once, so NOT plaintext-stored.

2 offset, in sectors/pages/bytes: written once, so NOT
plaintext-stored

3 length, in bytes.  Updated, so MUST be stored in the clear??  But
NOT if length held until 'close' in ram only.

Need two pointers, both of which ARE stored in the clear in the
Header.

1 Offset of next FAT entry, or index, equivalent.

2 Offset of next data write
