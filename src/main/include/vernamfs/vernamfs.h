 A 'Vernam File System' --- data storage based on a One Time Pad.  Named
 after Vernam (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Vernam), a
 pioneer in this area.

  A 'Vernam File System' (VFS) viewed as a struct would be

  struct {
    VFSHeader header;
    char padding[];
    VFSTableEntry table[T];
    char padding[];
    char data[D];
  } VFS;

  for some table entry capacity T and data area size D.  The padding
  areas are to ensure the table and data areas align on a suitable
  boundary (disk sector or memory page size??).  The length L of the
  filesystem is then just sizeof( struct VFS ).

  The table is a crude 'file allocation table' (FAT). Entries in this
  table are of type VFSTableEntry:

  typedef struct {
    uint64_t offset;
    uint64_t length;
    char path[128-16];		// LOOK: Make 128 configurable ??
  } VFSTableEntry;

  which contain the file 'name', where its content lives in the data
  area (the offset) and its length.  Both offset and length are in
  bytes.  The offset acts as a pointer from the table entry into the
  data area. Offsets are likely padded to next page/sector unit.

  As files are added to the VFS, the table grows.  It can never
  shrink.  A pointer in the header locates where the next table entry
  should go.

  If we want (and we do!) no 'information leak' from the table, we use
  the same xor process used for the data area (see below).  This means
  that we cannot read back the table entries (and so nor can anyone
  else).  In particular, we cannot read back the file names, and hence
  have no way of saying whether any file 'exists' already.  The
  conseqeunces of this are that

  1: we can't have a 'directory structure', only a single flat
  'bucket' into which all files go.

  2: files can be added 2+ times.  Any second (third, etc) write does
  NOT append to the orginal data.  Rather, it is treated as a separate
  file.  So a file with name F and content C1 can be added, and later
  a file also with name F but with content C2 can be added.  As far as
  the VernamFS is concerned, these files are unrelated.

  In essence, the 'filesystem' is just a list of pairs (P,C) where P
  is a string resembling a Unix file name, and C is the content (byte
  sequence) associated with that P.  There is no requirement that all
  Ps be unique.

  The 'backing store' for a VernamFS is a one-time-pad (OTP), i.e. a
  file (or whole device) whose initial contents are just random data
  (a OTP!)

  Only the header is ever stored 'as is' (in the clear) into the
  backing store.  It must be, since it is updated as files are written
  to the VFS.  The header must there be readable as well as writable.
  The writes must move along a 'table pointer' and a 'data pointer'.

  The table and data areas are stored by first reading the original
  OTP data at those offsets, xor'ing the plain text info (table entry
  data or actual data) with the original, and writing back the result
  to the backing store.  Any such write must only be done ONCE, else
  recovery of any plain text is impossible.  Further, since the table
  and data areas are XOR'ed on write, they cannot be recovered by a
  read.  In essence, both the table and data areas are write-only, or
  actually 'write-only-and-ONCE-only'.  Every single byte in the
  backing store past the Header must be written at MOST one time.

  TODO:

  1 Have redundant copies of the header and table throughout the backing
  store, perhaps at end?  

  2 Include 'fixups' as used in NTFS, where a multi-byte value write
  becomes atomic, eliminating (or reducing?)  chances of data
  structure corruption in either VFSHeader or VFSTableEntry?
