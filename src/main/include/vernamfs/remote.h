/**

 *
 * The rls and rcat commands produce similar payloads.  We can thus
 * capture that payload type as an 'object' and use it in both places.
 * Can also use this object type in the re-construction vault-side,
 * i.e. in vls and vcat.
 *
 * Basically, anything than be derived remotely and then shipped back
 * to the vault is of the form:
 *
 * 1 offset
 * 2 length	(exclusive, i.e. length of the data only)
 * 3 data
 *
 * and we build a struct according to that requirement.  We'll WRITE
 * such objects in rls and rcat invocations, and READ them is vls and
 * vcat invocations.
