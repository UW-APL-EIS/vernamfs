/**

 *
 * The 'rls' command enables us to print the VernamFS 'Table', which
 * contains metadata about each file written to the FS.  The table as
 * stored on the 'remote' unit is actually XOR'ed with the OTP, so is
 * unreadable.  However, we can cat it, so can use that cat result
 * later with a copy of the original OTP (the 'vault' copy) to recover
 * the actual table.  The rls result goes to stdout, as would a
 * regular Unix ls result.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * 1: On the 'remote unit': $ vernamfs rls OTP > ls.remote
 *
 * 2: Transport the ls.remote data to the 'vault location', where we
 * have a copy of the original OTP. 
 *
 * 3: Recover the actual listing: $ vernamfs vls OTPVAULT ls.remote
 *
 * The ls.remote result can also be supplied on stdin.  This is handy
 * for lab testing, the remote and vault locations are likely the
 * same, so
 *
 * $ vernamfs rls OTPREMOTE | vernamfs vls OTPVAULT
 *
 * @see vls.c
