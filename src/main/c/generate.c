 *
 * The 'generate' subcommand is used to produce an approximation of a
 * truly random one-time-pad by using the AES symmetric block cipher.
 *
 * See e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographically_secure_pseudorandom_number_generator
 *
 * Advantages of the 'CPRNG' approach:
 *
 * 1: The 'vault copy' of the OTP does not need to be 'stored' at all.
 * Instead, it can be regenerated at any time, i.e. at remote unit
 * recovery time.  All that is needed is the original aes key, which
 * obviously MUST be kept secured.
 *
 * 2: It is likely much faster to generate a large one-time-pad,
 * e.g. gigabytes, using a CPRNG over a truly random source.
 *
 * Disadvantages of the CPRNG approach:
 *
 * 1: It's NOT truly random, and so is not in the strictest sense a
 * true OTP.
 *
 * Currently we support only the AES-128 variant of aes, since that is
 * the only code we snarfed off the net to add to VernamFS.  This has
 * a 128-bit key.  If/when we locate a nice, clean, small AES-256
 * implementation (256-bit key), we'll add.
 *
 * We use aes in 'counter mode', aka CTR mode.  We simply increment
 * the counter from 0, and keep counting until the desired length of
 * OTP has been produced.
 *
 * Example usage, using some simple Unix tools to generate the 128-bit
 * key.  The generate command expects the key on stdin, as a
 * hex-encoded string:
 *
 * $ echo "The cat sat on the mat" | md5sum | cut -b 1-32 > KEY
 *
 * // A 1MB OTP, 2^20
 * $ vernamfs generate 20 < KEY
 *
 * // A 1GB OTP, 2^30
 * $ vernamfs generate 30 < KEY
 *
 * The key can also be echoed straight into the generator:
 *
 * $ echo 12345678901234567890123456789012 | vernamfs generate 10
 *
 *
 * Some performance numbers, on ptrav2 (author's laptop)
 *
 * log2 size	generation time - secs
 *		20		< 1
 *		24		8
 *		28		120
 *		30		480 
 *		32		2040
 *
 * Since we are using CTR mode, in theory we could parallelize the
 * generation, given each job a subsequence of the counter space.  In
 * practice, the aes code as is seems quick enough to be run
 * sequentially.
